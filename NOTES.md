How to build a CLI Gem

1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface-

      A command line interface for a daily recipe starting with All recipes

      Show today's recipe.
      1. Meal name - small description

      Would you like the recipe?(y/n)

      y = the recipe card
      n = Would you like to see staff picks? (y/n)

      y = 1. staff pick meal - small description
          2. staff pick meal - small description

      n = say goodbye


2. Start with the project structure - Google

      

3. Start with the entry point - the file run
4. Force that to build the CLI interface
5. Stub out the interface
6. Start making things real
7. Discover objects
8. Program

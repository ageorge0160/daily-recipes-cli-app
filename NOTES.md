How to build a CLI Gem

1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface-
2. Start with the project structure - Google
3. Start with the entry point - the file run
4. Force that to build the CLI interface
5. Stub out the interface
6. Start making things real
7. Discover objects
8. Program

      A command line interface for a daily recipe starting with Tamouse's blog

      Show today's recipe.
      Meal name - small description

      Select 'recipe card' or 'exit'
        recipe card

      Full recipe card:
      Title of Meal(scrape)
      Ingredients
      (scrape all list items)
      Directions
      (scrape all list items)

      exit

      say goodbye


Hello, I don't have a working mic but this is a 30 minute session of coding with me, Amanda.

I have built an app to scrape a recipe site to create a daily recipe and deliver a recipe card if wanted. I will be working on the second level of scraping so a recipe card can be created.
